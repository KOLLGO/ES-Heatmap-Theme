# ES-Heatmap-Theme
Several Themes for Emulationstation in a heatmap style. 
#Emulationstation
Emulationstation is used for emulating gaming consoles, you may see it used on a retropie, which this project is originally for. The themes work only for Emulationstation, not Emulationstation Desktop.

The theme is based on the Sapre Theme by Matt Kennedy: https://github.com/mattrixk/es-theme-spare
